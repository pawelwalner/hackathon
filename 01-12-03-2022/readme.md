# Application for managing contacts in address book.

## Concept of the solution:
- based on user commands: 
  -  `show` (to show the whole list of contacts),
  -  `add` (to add a new contact to the list),
  -  `remove` (to remove specific contact from the list),
  -  `exit` (to close the app),
- implemented 2D list,
- implemented `while` with `continue` and  the set of `if` `elif` `else`
